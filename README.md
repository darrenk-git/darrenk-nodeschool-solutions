# darrenk-nodeschool-solutions
Some of the solutions I've bodged together for nodeschool.io's exercises in an attempt to teach myself programming.
Honestly I'm learning tonnes with every exercise; from my failed attempts, comparing solutions and reading more about JavaScript.
I've also taken to re-writing other peoples solutions to drill into my mind why they have done things that I have not.

# Lessons I have learned so far

 * Node code looks wierd to me - I understand that statements in JavaScript need not end with a semi-colon when the statements are written with appropriate consideration.
    However I do not yet understand this well enough to trust myself writing javascript in such a style.
 * My first solutions tend to be long-winded, uninformed botch-jobs.
 * I am beginning to understand why callbacks are awesome. :O
 * the Array.prototype.forEach is a new iterator for me which I love using in place of my go-to for loop. (i.e. for ( i=0; i<array.length; i++ ) {/* do stuff */} ) 
 * js bits that I've learned:
 * what process.argv is and how to use it.
 * Array.prototype.filter
 * Array.prototype.push
 * what 'fs' is.
 * fs.readFileSync()
 * fs.readFile()
 * fs.readdir()
 * what 'path' is.
 * path.extname
 * how to write a simple one function module for node.js and use it in a program (toughest exercise for me so far, largest dividends!)
 
 So far I'm about half-way through the learnyounode exercises and I must say that even now I want to revisit my earlier solutions to apply what I have learned so far!
